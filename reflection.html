                <p class="card-text">I had issues with creating the menu. I didn't have a problem creating it.
                The problem was creating each menu item and making it "clickable". I was able to figure it out by
                referencing Bootstrap's documentation and also watching a tutorial.

                <p class="card-text">Figuring out the grid format and how to alter each cell was a task.
                    I knew that Bootstrap uses a default column number of 12. So I discovered how to resize each column width 
                    to allot for how much space I wanted it to take horizontally.

                <p class="card-text">I spent a long time trying to format the body for the composer pages.
                    I was able to create the number and size of rows and columns I needed for my grid, but it
                    didn't format exactly the way I wanted it to. I decided to try a different format for
                    the grid to match the required format for the assignment and I was able to make it look like
                    it needed to.
